- How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least 2 concrete examples

I thought I learned a lot throughout the project. It was mostly putting together a lot of different things that was learned throughout the semester in class, 
but it was still very fun for me. One thing I learned and implemented into my project was using Firebase for User Authentication and to have different users. 
Related to this, although we mentioned it, we didn't go over it in class really, was data persistence and storing all of the user data in Firebase and the reading 
it back for each individual user. Something else I used that I learned were UIPickers (I used multiple different cases of these), which were quite interesting

- What class material do you review? List at least 2 concrete examples
One piece of class material that I used was tableviews, as a I had multiple tableviews in my project. I also incorporated many small things that we went over in class such 
as the implementation of a search bar, segues, and using delegates to pass information between different views. 
- Do you plan on continuing to work on this project?
Yes, I want to make this project better and have a few more functionalities than it currently has.
